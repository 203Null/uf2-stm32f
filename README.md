# Bootloaders for the Pixhawk board family

## Build instructions

Build all targets:

```make```

The binaries will be in `build_BOARDNAME/BOARDNAME.elf`. Two files are built: ELF files for use with JTAG adapters and BIN files for direct onboard upgrading.

Build a specific board: Please check the `Makefile` for specific build targets.
